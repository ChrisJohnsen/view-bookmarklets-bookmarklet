    <h1>A Bookmarklet to View Bookmarklets</h1>

    <p id="try"> If you want to dive right in, here is the
    <a href="javascript:void(function(){@VBB_MINJS@;enableBookmarkletViewing();}())">bookmarklet</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="why">Why would anyone want this bookmarklet?</h2>

    <p>
    Mobile Safari in iOS only lets the user bookmark pages that have
    been loaded. This means that there is no direct way to save
    a bookmarklet in Mobile Safari since bookmarklets never actually
    load&mdash;they just run in the context of the current page
    instead of loading as a separate page.
    </p>

    <p>
    The normal way to add a bookmarklet to Mobile Safari is to save
    the bookmarklet with a desktop version of Safari and sync it to
    Mobile Safari. There is, however, an indirect way to add
    bookmarklets using only Mobile Safari:
    </p>

    <ol id="bookmarklet-steps">
      <li>Save a normal bookmark to a normal page (any page).</li>
      <li><div>Locate the code for the desired bookmarklet and copy
          it (tap and hold to select the "source code", then tap
          Copy).</div>
          <div>This is the hard part since the source code for most
          bookmarklets is never directly displayed (the bookmarklet
          offered on this page was created to work around this
          problem).</div></li>
      <li>Edit the bookmark created in step #1:
      <ol>
        <li>Tap and hold on the URL. Lift your tap once the
        positioning magnifier shows up.</li>
        <li>Tap Select All in the selection pop up menu.</li>
        <li>Tap Paste in the selection pop up menu.</li>
        <li><div>Rename the bookmark to reflect the function of the
              bookmarklet.</div>
            <div>Also (for iPads), you might want to put the
              bookmarklet in the special Bookmarks Bar folder so
              that it appears when you tap on the main URL
              bar.</div></li>
      </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
    The first two steps (create a bookmark, copy bookmarklet code)
    can be done in any order.
    </p>

    <h2 id="how">How do I use this bookmarklet?</h2>

    <p>
    The bookmarklet from this page will modify all bookmarklets on
    your current page so that they display their code instead of
    running that code. Once you have it installed as a bookmarklet,
    you can use it on other pages to install bookmarklets that are
    otherwise not directly installable (in Mobile Safari).
    </p>

    <p>
    When a modified bookmarklet is triggered, the whole page is
    overlaid with a temporary "code display". It will look something like this:
    </p>

    <div id="demo-overlay">
      <div id="demo-container">
        <div id="demo-instructions">
          <div><a href="javascript:void('noop')">Tap to disable.</a></div>
          <div>Tap outside to return.</div>
        </div>
        <textarea id="demo-textarea" rows="20" cols="2">javascript:'The code is shown here.'</textarea>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
    While the code is displayed, you may:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>select and Copy it (to make save a bookmarklet in Mobile
      Safari), or</li>
      <li>tap anywhere outside the main box to return to the
      original page, or </li>
      <li>tap on the "disable" link inside the main box to disable
      bookmarklet viewing (i.e. make tapping on a bookmarklet run
      its code, like normal).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="install">How do I install this bookmarklet?</h2>

    <p>
    Use the bookmarklet <a href="#try">link on this page</a> to
    reveal its own source code.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Tap it once to enable the viewing functionality.</li>
      <li>Tap it again to actually view its source code.</li>
      <li>Use the <a href="#bookmarklet-steps">workaround bookmarklet
        installation procedure</a> to install this bookmarklet.</li>
      <li>Use it on any other page with bookmarklets.</li>
    </ol>
  </body>
</html>
